export const ABOUT_ME = "I bring a combination of technical expertise and creativity, developed through rigorous training and diverse professional experiences. After completing a full-time Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, where I gained over 420 hours of hands-on experience, I built a strong foundation in Python, JavaScript, and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). My training also included building robust back-end systems with Python/Django and designing user-centered applications, where I consistently applied my problem-solving skills to tackle complex challenges. I am experienced in developing, testing, and maintaining web applications, with a focus on high quality, efficient code that meets today’s industry standards. In addition to my software engineering background, I am also a dedicated musician, with features on HBO and BET, bringing a unique blend of technical rigor and creative perspective. Ready to leverage my skills and proactive work ethic, I’m excited to join a forward-thinking team where I can contribute to meaningful, innovative projects."
